5. **Create a superuser (admin):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Start RabbitMQ (required for Celery):**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server

   or on macOS (Homebrew):

   ```bash
   brew services start rabbitmq
   ```

7. **Start Celery worker:**

## Background Tasks

* **Celery + RabbitMQ**: Offloads long-running tasks such as sending emails.
* **Booking Email**: `send_booking_email` task sends a confirmation email asynchronously when a booking is created.

Example usage in `BookingViewSet`:

```python
from listings.tasks import send_booking_email

def perform_create(self, serializer):
    booking = serializer.save(guest=self.request.user)
    send_booking_email.delay(booking.guest.email, str(booking.booking_id))
```

## Permissions & Roles

Uses Djangoâ€™s built-in permission system. Example permissions:

* `add_listing`, `change_listing`, `delete_listing`, `view_listing`
* `add_booking`, `change_booking`, `delete_booking`, `view_booking`
* `add_review`, `change_review`, `delete_review`, `view_review`
* `add_payment`, `change_payment`, `view_payment`


## ðŸš€ Deployment on Render

1. **Connect Repository**

   * Go to [Render Dashboard](https://render.com) and create a new **Web Service**.
   * Select your repository (e.g., `alx_travel_app_0x03`) and the branch to deploy.

2. **Environment**

   * Choose **Docker** as the environment.
   * Render will automatically build your Docker image using your `Dockerfile`.

3. **Set Environment Variables**

   * In Renderâ€™s **Environment** tab, add all variables listed in `.env_example`.
   * Render uses these values at runtime; no need to expose secrets in the repo.

4. **Build & Start**

   * Render automatically runs `docker build` and `CMD ["gunicorn", "alx_travel_app.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]`.
   * Port `8000` is exposed; Render routes traffic externally.

5. **Background Tasks (Optional)**

   * If using Celery + RabbitMQ, add **Worker Services** in Render pointing to the same repo.
   * Configure `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` in environment variables.

6. **Static Files**

   * Already handled during Docker build with `python manage.py collectstatic`.
   * Served in production via Whitenoise.

7. **Automatic Deployment**

   * Every push to the connected branch triggers a rebuild and redeploy.
   * No manual steps requiredâ€”Render handles the container lifecycle.
